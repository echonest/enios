ENiOS
============

The ENiOS library is an open source Objective-C library for the Echo Nest APIs. It provides the iOS/Objective-C programmer full access to all of the Echo Nest methods including those for artists, songs, playlisting, and taste profiles, as well as methods for retrieving detailed analysis information about an uploaded track. It also includes an example app to demonstrate how to integrate this library into an XCode project.

Note: This library is an update to our previous libechonest library, which removes several dependencies and simplifies the code needed to interact with our API. Although we will continue to keep libechonest available on a limited basis, we recommend using this library for all iOS projects moving forward.

The preferred way to include this library is to reference the project as a static library, from either an ARC or a Memory Managed development environment.


Quick Start Example
========================

1. Create a new folder called 'ENWorkspace", and clone the ENAPILibrary contents into that folder.

2. Create a new workspace folder for your project in the same folder and name it something like 'MyWorkspace'.

3. In Xcode, create a new Project Workspace by selecting File/New/Workspace and save it in the 'MyWorkspace' folder. Title it something like 'MyWorkspace'.

4. Right click in the project navigator window and create your new project. Title it something like 'MyProject'. (Alternately, for adding the ENAPILibrary to an existing project: in the Finder, drag an existing project folder into the MyProjectsWorkspace folder, then add the project to the workspace in Xcode by dragging the .xcodeproj file into the project navigator window.)

5. Right click on 'MyProject' in the project navigator and select Add Files to 'MyProject'. Navigate to the file 'ENAPILibrary.xcodeproj' in the ENAPILibrary folder, and add it to your project.

6. Select the 'MyProject' target. In 'Build Settings' tab for this target, find the line 'User Header Search Paths' and paste the string '"${SRCROOT}"/../../**' into this value to point to a directory above the ENAPILibrary.

7. Select the 'MyProject' target. In 'Build Phases', expand 'Target Dependencies' and select the '+' button. Add ENAPILibrary.  

8. Select the 'MyProject' target. In 'Build Phases' expand 'Link Binary With Libraries' and select the '+' button. Add the ENAPILibrary library and the Apple MediaPlayer framework.

9. In your project's "AppDelegate.m" file, include the line '#import "ENAPI.h"' at the top below the other imports.

10. In the AppDelegate.m file, within the '- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions' method, include the line:

        [ENAPIRequest setApiKey:@"DEFAULTAPIKEY"];

11. Change the default api key value to your Echo Nest API Key.

12. Use the ENAPIRequest class methods "GETWithEndpoint:andParameters:andCompletionBlock" and  "POSTWithEndpoint:andParameters:andCompletionBlock" to interact with the Echo Nest web services.
